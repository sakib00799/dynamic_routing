Next Steps:

1.Increase Graph Complexity:
You could try sampling a larger set of edges to create a more complex graph. More nodes and edges would give the LLM a wider range of potential paths to influence.

2.Increase Penalties:
If you want to test whether the penalties can make a more substantial impact, try increasing the penalty weights applied by the LLM to see if this shifts the paths.

3.Improve Data Handling:
Ensure that the LLM output is valid and that it’s processed correctly, as the warnings suggest the model might not have returned the expected output format.

4.Run Larger Benchmarks:
Consider running the experiment on larger time windows or with more timestamps to see if the LLM influences the paths over a longer duration.
